Champion a Goblin (When this enters the battlefield, sacrifice it unless you exile another Goblin you control. When this leaves the battlefield, that card returns to the battlefield.)  Whenever a Goblin you control deals combat damage to a player, you may put a 1/1 black Goblin Rogue creature token onto the battlefield.
